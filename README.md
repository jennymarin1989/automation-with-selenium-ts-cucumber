## Approach

The main goal of this project is to practice the implementation of Behaviour Driven Development on test automation by creating a framework with tools like Selenium, Cucumber, Gherkin and a typed javascript language like Typescript. This approach will allow me to create test specifications in a human-redable way, utilising 'Gherkin' syntax and allowing 'Cucumber' to read those specifications and validate the software functionality. In this case, automated tests were created to review the functionality of main fetures in [Saucedemo website](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
